# Simple Wordpress Rest Demo
Just messing around with wordpress rest functionality. It's pretty easy to use.

This one creates two endpoints:
1. /wp-json/MediaMind/Index
2. /wp-json/MediaMind/AliensHaveLanded

The first will suggest clothing options for animals.
The second has a date and time, as well as the first question you should ask if
you're an alien visitor landing on a new planet.

Nothing special in the code.
Should run on old php installations as far back as 5.4 (please don't run anything on 5.4)
